# Hello-World
A way of testing that cloning/committing/pushing is working for you

Here are the first two lines of a popular English niursery rhyme:

Mary had a little lamb.
It's fleece was white as snow.
...[next 2 lines go here]...

Your job is to Google the next two lines of this nursery rhyme.
Then add the third line by directly editing this file on Github.
Then add the fourth line byclone this repository using R studio, updating the Rmarkdown and then pushing it back onto Github.

You should need to complete the following steps.
1. Accept the intivation to this assignment, and then go to the repository that is created for you at github.com
2. Click on the link to edit this Readme.Rmd file and manually add the third line.
3. Commit your change, and don't forgot to add a commit message.
At this point your changes should be visible to me.

Now, for the fourth line:
4. Go to Rstudio and click on File / New Project, then choose the option "Version Control" followed by "Git"
5. At this point you will be prompted to enter the url for your repository for this problem on github. 
It will look something like "https://github.com/PM520-Spring-2020/hello-world-username".
At tyhis point you will be prompted to enter your github usernamer and password.
6. You should now have a copy of the repository on your local machine, in the form of an Rproject.
7. Open the file Readme.md and add the fourth line of the nursery rhyme.
8. You now need to "commit" (save a permanent record of) the changes to your local machine, and then "push" the changerd back to github.com. First look for and click the Git tab in your Rstudio Gui (for me it is at the top of the window to top right of the gui. then check the box for the files you want to commit (here, just the Readme.md will do) and hit the "commit" button. In the process of doing this it wil prompt you to enter a commit message. This is a reminder of what you changed in this edit. So something like "added 4th line of nursery rhyme" will do here. You hsoudl get into the habit of adding an explanation to every commit.
9. Now you are ready to push the changes back to github.  Look for the commit button and hit it. If you don't get an error message your new version will now replace the one that was on Github, so go to your repository on Github and check that you see it there. (You will need to refresh that window if you already have it open in your browser.
Your work is done.
